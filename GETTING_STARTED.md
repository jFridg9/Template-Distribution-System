## 🚀 Development Workflow

### Recommended Approach (Manual Deployment)

**Local Development:**
```powershell
# Edit code in VS Code
# Test your changes

# Push to Apps Script
clasp push

# Open in browser to deploy
# Visit: https://script.google.com/d/1SK3t1h_w8n5KLGLAB073Ex72xwhC59tRwKfFldej_X2ZHwvgQkDPgEAB/edit
```

**Version Control:**
```powershell
# Commit your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Description of changes"
git push
```

**Deployment:**
1. Test locally with `clasp push`
2. Open Apps Script editor
3. Deploy → Manage deployments → Edit or New deployment
4. Test the web app URL

## 📝 Next Steps to Deploy

### Option A: Automated Setup (Recommended) ⭐

**Fully automated - no manual configuration needed!**

1. **Deploy as Web App** (one-time):
   - In Apps Script editor: Deploy → New deployment
   - Type: Web app
   - Execute as: Me (pittsburgh@usbg.org)
   - Who has access: Anyone (or as needed)
   - Click Deploy
   - Copy the /exec URL

2. **Access Admin Panel**: Visit `/exec?admin=true`

3. **Setup Wizard Runs Automatically**:
   - Detects no configuration exists
   - Click to create configuration sheet → **Automatically linked!**
   - Add first product using Drive Picker → **No ID copying!**
   - Complete setup → Access admin panel

**That's it!** No code changes, no manual ID copying, no sheet editing.

### Optional: Vanity URL / Redirect (recommended for branding)

If you want product links to use a branded URL (for example `https://usbg.org/template`) you can configure a simple redirect on your web server or edge worker that forwards visitors to the Apps Script `/exec` URL. The project stores an optional `PUBLIC_WEBAPP_URL` (Script Property) which the Admin UI will prefer when generating "Copy Link" URLs.

Important: setting `PUBLIC_WEBAPP_URL` only changes the links generated by the admin UI — it does not make Apps Script run on your domain. To make the vanity link usable you must configure a redirect or proxy on your domain.

Recommended: configure a redirect so the vanity link forwards to the Apps Script exec URL. This is the simplest and most reliable approach.

Nginx example (simple 302 redirect):

```nginx
location /template {
   return 302 https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfy.../exec;
}
```

Cloudflare Worker (edge redirect) example:

```js
addEventListener('fetch', event => {
   const url = new URL(event.request.url);
   if (url.pathname === '/template') {
      return event.respondWith(Response.redirect('https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfy.../exec', 302));
   }
   return event.respondWith(fetch(event.request));
});
```

How to use with this project:
- Deploy the web app (copy the `/exec` URL).
- Configure your server or edge rule to redirect the vanity path to the `/exec` URL.
- In the Admin Panel (⚙️ Set Public URL) paste the vanity URL (for example `https://usbg.org/template`) into the prompt and save — the app will validate the URL and warn if it doesn't appear to redirect to Apps Script.
- Now the Admin "Copy Link" button will generate links using the vanity URL.

Notes and caveats:
- The browser address bar will change to the Apps Script URL after the redirect. This is expected for a simple redirect. If you need the browser to retain `usbg.org` for the full session you must implement a domain-preserving reverse proxy (more complex; see docs above for tradeoffs).
- If you later change the Apps Script deployment URL, update the redirect target on your server and the `PUBLIC_WEBAPP_URL` if necessary.


### Option B: Manual Setup (Advanced)

If you prefer full control or want to understand the internals:

1. **Create Configuration Sheet**:
   - In Apps Script editor, run function: `createConfigurationSheet`
   - Copy the Spreadsheet ID from logs

2. **Update CONFIG** (Code.gs):
   ```javascript
   const CONFIG = {
     mode: 'simple',  // or 'full'
     configSheetId: 'PASTE_SPREADSHEET_ID_HERE',
     branding: {
       organizationName: 'USBG Pittsburgh',
       tagline: 'Member Resources',
       supportEmail: 'pittsburgh@usbg.org'
     }
   };
   ```

3. **Configure Products**:
   - Open configuration sheet
   - Fill in product names, folder IDs, descriptions
   - Set enabled = TRUE for active products

4. **Deploy as Web App** (same as Option A step 1)

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Cannot push to Apps Script"
```powershell
clasp logout
clasp login --no-localhost
# Follow authentication prompts
clasp push
```

### "Script project not found"
Check `.clasp.json` contains correct `scriptId`

### "Permission denied"
Ensure you're logged in as pittsburgh@usbg.org

## 🎯 CI/CD Status

**Current approach:** Manual deployment (recommended)
- Local development with clasp
- Manual deployment from Apps Script UI
- Git for version control

**Why:** Apps Script OAuth tokens require interactive browser auth, making CI/CD complex. Manual deployment is standard practice for Apps Script projects.

**Future:** Could migrate to service account auth or Apps Script API for full automation.

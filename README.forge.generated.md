## Forge (Local MCP) — Quick Start

<!-- NOTE: This file was generated by Forge initialization. -->
<!-- Manually merge this content into your main README.md -->

This repository includes configuration files to integrate with a local MCP agent named **Forge**.

### What Forge does:
- Stores "lessons learned" and project patterns locally at `~/.forge_memory/`.
- Helps Copilot or other Chat UIs recall prior fixes and context across sessions.
- Coordinates with subagents: **Sol** (deployments/automation) and **Astra** (portfolio & career artifacts).

### Files added:
- `.vscode/copilot-agents.json`
- `.vscode/forge.json`
- `forge.mcp.json`
- `.copilot/context/README.md`

### Manual steps (run locally):

1. Create your local memory directory:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.forge_memory
   echo '[]' > ~/.forge_memory/project-cache.json
   echo '[]' > ~/.forge_memory/vector-db.json
   ```

2. Review the generated files and commit them to your repo.

3. Optional: add a GitHub Actions workflow to sync the memory (encrypted) or to back it up.

### Security note:

Keep `~/.forge_memory/` local and never commit secrets to Git. If you back up memory to GitHub, encrypt it first.

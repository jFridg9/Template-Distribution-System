## 🔒 Security & Access

### Who Can Access Admin Panel?

**Production Mode:**
- Only the deployer (person who deployed the web app)
- Other users see "Access denied"

**Development Mode:**
- May allow any logged-in user (for testing)

### Why Restrict Access?

- Prevents unauthorized product changes
- Maintains system integrity
- Protects configuration data

### Changing Deployer

If you need to transfer admin access:
1. Redeploy web app as different user in Apps Script editor
2. New deployer becomes admin
3. Previous deployer loses access
